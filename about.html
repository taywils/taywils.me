<h3>My Undergrad Physics Research</h3>
<div class='post-content'>

During my time in college as a physics major I, like most other physics majors was employed in a laboratory where I got to do some cool things with some very expensive equipment.

In the summer of 2010 I participated in the National Science Foundation's summer <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;from=fund">Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> program at <a href="http://www.physics.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University's Department of Physics</a>. In case you are unaware of the NSF REU program you can kinda think of it like Google's Summer of Code but for science majors instead of computer science majors and much like Google's Summer of Code the NSF REU program also suffers from the same ridiculously low acceptance rate given the insanely high number of applicants. Anyways the research I worked on during my 2010 REU session involved the optical spectroscopic analysis of Europium doped Gallium Nitride, a wide band gap semiconductor with lots of possible applications such as producing violet lasers(higher frequency than blue lasers) and solar cell panels. For more information though just <a href="http://code2live.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2010-Summer-REU-Abstract.pdf">check out the abstract for the research which is a brief technical summary of work by clicking on this link</a>. In addition you can also see the poster I created for the research project below.

Next, during my junior and senior years as a physics undergraduate I worked within the surface dynamics laboratory at <a href="http://physics.wsu.edu">WSU's department of physics and astronomy</a>(if you're lucky you might even see a picture of me in the lab on the homepage... ok they might have taken it down by now being that I graduated but still). Moving along, the focus of my research which also served as my senior undergraduate thesis was on the ion emission spectroscopy of Zinc Oxide, another wide band gap semiconductor with lots of neat applications for developing faster chips and more efficient solar array cells. In short the research involved the optical analysis or what happens when you fire a 248 nm pulsed laser at chunk of vacuum sealed Zinc Oxide and measure the emissions under varying conditions. As usual for a more detailed and highly technical description please see <a href="http://code2live.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/D_Wilson_Senior_Thesis.pdf">my senior thesis on the subject</a>. In addition you should also check out the poster I created for the research project down below.
