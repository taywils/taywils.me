		<h2>Short Bio</h2>
		Hello visitor.<p />
		Thanks for stopping by, I enjoy solving problems using software as a tool and my intrests are expansive and varied.
		I've covered many areas of technical development and design as I written database schemas, coded Android apps, won prizes at a few hackathons
		and even did all the styling and design for this here blog. Constantly a work in progress I'm looking forward to specializing in a particular area
		of software engineering at the moment in order to achieve mastery and the increased efficieny that comes along with it.
		<p />
		<h3>What will I eventually specialize in?</h3>
			<ul class='no-bullets'>
				<li><b>Ruby On Rails Javascript Frontend Developer</b></li>

					<br />

					<ul class='no-bullets'>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> There are obvious reasons for this as most of my actual experience is with web development</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> Rails combines a quick time to market with a powerful dynamic language and rich environment/tools</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> I can go from concept to viable product and easily transistion to becoming a founder/entreprenuer</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> With the releases of Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.0 the tech stack has matured</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will need to study more design and become comfortable with MV* Javascript frameworks</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The web moves fast... can I keep up?</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design is rapidly becoming almost more important than functioning code. Is this where I belong?</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnout and failure are commonplace in the delirious world of startups. It's happened to me once already</li>
					</ul>

					<br />

				<li><b>C++ network/systems developer or Financial Engineer</b></li>

					<br />

					<ul class='no-bullets'>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> Advanced mathematics/systems programming are more interesting to me than yet another MVC framework</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> One the things I miss the most about mathematical computing was the focus on optimization</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> Data structures and algorithms are treated as first class citizens in the Financial Engineering World</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> Companies are driven by market expectations, and funded by investments; I wish to learn more about Finance</li>
						<li><span style="color: green;">+</span> Living in New York or London or even Tokyo doesn't sound too bad ^_^</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will probably need to acquire a Masters Degree from a reputable Finance program</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its tough to get a feel for Financial markets without significant initial investment into a portfolio</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; A large part of the finance world is powered by Python... my Ruby skills will be useless</li>
						<li><span style="color: red;">-</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Will need to gain significant development experience in C++, which is harder get compared to Web dev</li>

<h3>My Undergrad Physics Research</h3>
<div class='post-content'>

During my time in college as a physics major I, like most other physics majors was employed in a laboratory where I got to do some cool things with some very expensive equipment.

In the summer of 2010 I participated in the National Science Foundation's summer <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&amp;from=fund">Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> program at <a href="http://www.physics.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University's Department of Physics</a>. In case you are unaware of the NSF REU program you can kinda think of it like Google's Summer of Code but for science majors instead of computer science majors and much like Google's Summer of Code the NSF REU program also suffers from the same ridiculously low acceptance rate given the insanely high number of applicants. Anyways the research I worked on during my 2010 REU session involved the optical spectroscopic analysis of Europium doped Gallium Nitride, a wide band gap semiconductor with lots of possible applications such as producing violet lasers(higher frequency than blue lasers) and solar cell panels. For more information though just <a href="http://code2live.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2010-Summer-REU-Abstract.pdf">check out the abstract for the research which is a brief technical summary of work by clicking on this link</a>. In addition you can also see the poster I created for the research project below.

Next, during my junior and senior years as a physics undergraduate I worked within the surface dynamics laboratory at <a href="http://physics.wsu.edu">WSU's department of physics and astronomy</a>(if you're lucky you might even see a picture of me in the lab on the homepage... ok they might have taken it down by now being that I graduated but still). Moving along, the focus of my research which also served as my senior undergraduate thesis was on the ion emission spectroscopy of Zinc Oxide, another wide band gap semiconductor with lots of neat applications for developing faster chips and more efficient solar array cells. In short the research involved the optical analysis or what happens when you fire a 248 nm pulsed laser at chunk of vacuum sealed Zinc Oxide and measure the emissions under varying conditions. As usual for a more detailed and highly technical description please see <a href="http://code2live.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/D_Wilson_Senior_Thesis.pdf">my senior thesis on the subject</a>. In addition you should also check out the poster I created for the research project down below.
