		<h2>Short Bio</h2>
		Hello visitor.
		<p /> Thanks for stopping by, I enjoy solving problems using software as a tool and my intrests are expansive and varied. I've
		covered many areas of technical development and design as I've written database schemas, coded Android apps, won prizes
		at a few hackathons and even did all the styling and design for this here blog. Constantly a work in progress I'm looking
		forward to specializing in a particular area of software engineering at the moment in order to achieve mastery and the
		increased efficiency that comes along with it.
		<p />
