Welcome to taywils.me my personal blog for everything I do related to software engineering, web development and programming. On a day to day basis I'm currently employed at a startup working in the E-Commerce sector but in my spare time I develop apps in hopes of running my own software development company someday.

## Current Interest
As of late I've been writing a lot of software in Javascript and Ruby; mostly React and Ruby on Rails. Due to the maturity and large size of both Javascript's and Ruby's respective developer communities those platforms are most aligned with quickly building out prototypes and MVPs.
