Welcome to taywils.me my personal blog for everything I do related to software engineering, web development and programming. I tend to keep this blog focused purely on programming and for posting updates on my on-going projects.

If you wish to know more about my background and or work history I have a a public GitHub profile as well as an account on LinkedIn.
