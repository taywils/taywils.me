Welcome to taywils.me my blog for everything programming, software engineering and math related subjects that interest me. Occasionally there will longer posts that form multi-part tutorials however; a majority of the code I write can be found on my Github.
Originally I started off on a hosted Wordpress site, then moved to a private Linode server and re-wrote this blog using Jeykll, stopped blogging for about 3 years and recently discovered Hexo which gave me renewed faith in customizable static-site blogging platforms that give you just enough but not too much.
