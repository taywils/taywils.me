QALite is a basic Question and Answer Board that's designed to be embedded within a larger site, it was built using MongoDB and a neat MVC PHP framework called Lithium. If you've ever been curious as to how to create a basic questions and answers site or would just like to see an example of applying MVC to PHP then you should definately check it out.
