BTHREE is a simple fun clever little casual tapper game where quick reflexes and a bit of timing will reward you with the top score. Built as an in-house app we here at TreapNode are seeking to expand into the casual gaming market with our first game.

Youâ€™ll be taken to the game sreen, at the top is the current score. The three white blocks are the main actors of the game; the objective is to tap any of the three colors which accelerate the blocks upward.

The score increments every second but there are rules for earning extra points. For instance you can collect power-ups that will award bonus points and either help or hinder your progress.

## Game Over Screen

Gameover is triggered once every block has hit the floor. From this point on you can either shake the phone to begin a new round or view the leaderboard to compare your highest score.
