Welcome to part III of the Realtime Whiteboard App with NodeJS. In this last part I will provide a link to the Android client that I wrote some time ago in Java which targeted the Android SDK version 19.

## Part III: Android Client in Java

I dug up the old code while writing the previous articles in this tutorial and as it turns out with the release of the latest Android Studio from Google I couldn't quite get the configuration with Gradle setup to run the application on my Nexus 7 device.

As a result of having exhausted an entire afternoon of goofing around with the various settings and configurations in Android Studio I have resigned to just providing a link to the existing source code at the time I compiled it for readers to digest.
