free beta mode(with ads) right now as I plan on adding more features later such as the ability to design/store your own logos as preferences and an actual user interface that uses the [action bar design pattern][link_android_dev_actionbar] which is so popular nowadays.\n\n### 1) Not knowing Java is not an excuse. \n\nIf you don’t know any Java but you’re proficient in a C-based or C-styled syntax programming language such as C#, C++, PHP  and or any others then you can easily absorb Java as you browse Android tutorials, read Android dev books and begin to poke around with the Android API.
