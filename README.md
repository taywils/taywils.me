# Blog Migration To Hexo

Finally going to start blogging again; took a look at my old jekyll site and decided to try something more modern.
There were several new static site generators that have popped up in recent years but [Hexo][link_hexo] appeared the most promising.

## Taywils.me Jekyll to Hexo Migration

- [] Convert all non Markdown blog posts over to Markdown
- [] Copy Markdowm blog posts to Hexo source posts directory
