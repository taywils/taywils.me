# Blog Migration To Hexo

Finally going to start blogging again; took a look at my old jekyll site and decided to try something more modern.

## Taywils.me Jekyll to Hexo Migration

-[] Create git orphan branch
-[] Download and install Hexo
-[] Start off with a basic Hexo theme, I'll design my own or customize later
-[] Convert all non Markdown blog posts over to Markdown
