description: In this tutorial we'll step through the process of using the Android's builtin support for SqlLite to store a password and retrive it in a rather interesting attempt at creating a guest dialer application. When I first imagined a guest dialer I had in mind an application that would allow you to let someone use your phone without giving them total access to your incomming messages and other sensitive data. However, a lock-in application basically classifies as a virus when you think about it so whatever... at least I learned about the SqlLite api ^_^
