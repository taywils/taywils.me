description: Although it wasn't easy I finally migrated my blog over to Jekyll. Personally I have nothing against the fantastic work of software that is WordPress it really helped a lot of people all across the world get into blogging and sharing their thoughts but WordPress is at its heart a CMS. Although commonly used to host blogs WordPress is greatly under-utilized as a blogging platform and many of its features become rather obtrusive from a single users perspective.
